## Pull Requests

Pull requests allow you to contribute to TechBlitz by suggestion changes to the codebase.
We have a few guidelines that we ask you to follow when creating pull requests.

### Creating a Pull Request

In an ideal world, the pull request should be created via an issue. This allows us to track the issue and the pull request together.

If you do not have an issue, you can create one by clicking the "Create issue" button in the top right corner of the repository.

There is more information about creating issues [here](/open-source/issues).

### Pull Request Title

The title of each pull request should be a short description of the changes you are making. It should be no more than 70 characters.

### Pull Request Description

The description of each pull request should be a detailed description of the changes you are making.

It should include the motivation for the changes and the details of the changes.

Although preview urls are generated, please do attach screenshots of the changes you are making to make
reviewing the pull request easier.
