## Pull Requests

Pull requests allow you to contribute to TechBlitz by suggestion changes to the codebase.
We have a few guidelines that we ask you to follow when creating pull requests.

### Creating a Pull Request

In an ideal world, the pull request should be created via an issue. This allows us to track the issue and the pull request together.

If you do not have an issue, you can create one by clicking the "Create issue" button in the top right corner of the repository.

There is more information about creating issues [here](/open-source/issues).
