## TechBlitz's Style Guide

In order to maintain a high standard of code quality, and consistency, we have a style guide that
we ask you to follow when contributing to TechBlitz.

### General

Although Prettier is used to format the code (and should be formatted on save), it's always good to know
the guidelines when writing code.

Here are the main rules we enforce:

- Use single quotes ('') over double quotes** ("").**
- Use arrow functions over function declarations.
- Use `const` or `let` over `var`.
- Semicolons are required.

### File Structure

- All new components should go in `@/components` and be named like `[component-name].tsx` unless otherwise specified.
- All new pages go in `@/app/[page-name]/page.tsx`.
- Fetching data on the server belong in the `@/utils/data` directory.
- The lib and utils folders have different meanings:
  - `@/lib` is for third party libraries.
  - `@/utils` is for utility functions (except for `cn`, due to ShadCn's use of it, but we may change this in the future).
